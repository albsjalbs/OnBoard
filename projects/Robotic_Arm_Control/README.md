# Robotic Arm control, Arduino Expansion Board

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->:
I wanted to make a pcb that would make it easy to control a robotic arm that I made. The Robotic arm has 6 motors which,
equal 18 wires so i made a pcb so that i can snap the arduino on the PCB and connect the servos directlty to the PCB.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->:
I believe the PCB is $4.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->:
I just learned how to use Kicad like three days ago so it was challenging to get everything to work but in the end it all worked out:)
There were alot of tutorials that helped on the way.



Thank You:) <3
